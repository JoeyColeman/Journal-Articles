### Overview

Submitting an opinion article for consideration to the [The Canadian Journal of Local Government](http://www.cjlg.ca/) on municipal livestreaming. 

The article will discuss how livestreaming boosts civic engagement, increases public confidence in local government, can be a form of open data, and both the importance and ease of adopting YouTube due to its ubiquitous reach to video devices.

There is no guarantee or commitment that this will be published. I've wanted to engage in this information gathering for awhile anyway, and it's a good distraction from the day-to-day grind of covering Hamilton City Council.

I hope the information I find will be used by others; especially once I've created a CSV speadsheet that includes links to all Ontario municipalities.
